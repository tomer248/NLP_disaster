Using NLP to predict if a tweet about a disaster is Real or Fake

This is one of my Kaggle challanges and the first NLP Kaggle challange that i attended.
I have used Naive Bayes and Xgboost with the bag of words implementation for this case.
My best attempt was with 1700 words(in the bag of words) with 77% successfull predictions on the Kaggel test.
